Hello! My name is Tova Hirschhorn. I hold an MBA and am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics at [Zicklin School of Business](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/) - right here in my hometown of New York City.

I am passionate about data analysis, statistics, and quantitative methods to solve real-world business problems.

This website showcases my course projects and assignments from STA 9750 - Fall 2025. Feel free to explore all the data analysis tools and techniques I learned and applied throughout the semester!
